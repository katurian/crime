# crime

## Stuff I learned:

* CLEAN YOUR DATA IN EXCEL/R BEFORE VISUALIZING IT.
* Check the data types of your variables in R (character, numerical value, etc.)
* According to this graph, there really isn't a correlation between population density and crime? Or I graphed it wrong. Probably the latter.
